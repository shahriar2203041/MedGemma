# MedGemma Notebooks

*   [Quick start with Hugging Face](quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Example of generating responses from medical text and images by running the
    model locally from Hugging Face.

*   [Quick start with Model Garden](quick_start_with_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Example of serving the model on
    [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/overview)
    and using Vertex AI APIs to generate responses from medical text and images
    in online or batch workflows.

*   [Fine-tune with Hugging Face](fine_tune_with_hugging_face.ipynb) - Example
    of fine-tuning the model with Low-Rank Adaptation Supervised Fine-tuning
    (SFT) and LoRA using Hugging Face libraries.

*   [Quick start with Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM)](quick_start_with_dicom.ipynb) -
    Example of using DICOM-aware MedGemma deployments which can handle medical
    image retrieval and pre-processing on the server side.

*   [Electronic Health Record (EHR) Navigator Agent](ehr_navigator_agent.ipynb) -
    Demonstration of an AI agent using MedGemma to intelligently navigate
    patients' large and complex EHR data in Fast Healthcare Interoperability
    Resources (FHIR) format.

*   [Reinforcement learning with Hugging Face](reinforcement_learning_with_hugging_face.ipynb) - Example of
    fine-tuning the model using reinforcement learning, a tuning method of
    tuning that is particularly effective at learning complex tasks without
    compromising existing model abilities.

## New with MedGemma 1.5

*   [Chest X-ray anatomy localization](cxr_anatomy_localization_with_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Illustrates how to perform a localization task with MedGemma 1.5 using
    Hugging Face libraries and running the model locally.

*   [Chest X-ray longitudinal comparison](cxr_longitudinal_comparison_with_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Walks through how to perform longitudinal comparison of chest X-ray (CXR)
    images with MedGemma 1.5 using Hugging Face libraries and running the model
    locally.

*   [Analyze Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging - Hugging Face](high_dimensional_ct_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Explores how 3D representation of computed tomography (CT) imaging can be
    used to prompt a locally running MedGemma 1.5 using the Hugging Face
    libraries.

*   [Analyze Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging - Model Garden](high_dimensional_ct_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Showcases how 3D representation of computed tomography (CT) imaging can be
    used to prompt MedGemma 1.5 running on Vertex AI.

*   [Analyze Whole Slide Digital Pathology Imaging - Hugging Face](high_dimensional_pathology_hugging_face.ipynb) -
    Demonstrates how to use digital pathology whole slide imaging to prompt a
    locally running MedGemma 1.5 using the Hugging Face libraries.

*   [Analyze Whole Slide Digital Pathology Imaging - Model Garden](high_dimensional_pathology_model_garden.ipynb) -
    Presents how to use digital pathology whole slide imaging to prompt MedGemma
    1.5 running on VertexAI.
